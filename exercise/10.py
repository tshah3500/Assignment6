# Group Challenge
# I have provided you with a file called spanish_to_english.dat
# that represents a pickled dictionary where the keys are in spanish, 
# and the values are in english. (It only has around 10 words, 
# not by any means a complete dictionary unfortunately).
# Translation courtesy of Google Translate :) 

# Task 1 unpickle the dictionary and assigned it to the variable
# spa_eng_dict. 
# This should be 1 line of code that starts with...
# spa_eng_dict = ???

# Task 2:
# Create a file named translation named translation.txt
# for each line, give the english translation of a spanish word
# that's in the words list. Make sure it's ordered accordingly.
# this means that the first line in the file should be cat, while the
# second line should be university. 
# if a word is not in the spa_eng_dict, then write "unknown" on the line.
# I have provided a file called translation_ans.txt to show you what
# the final result should look like.
